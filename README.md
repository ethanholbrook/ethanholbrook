Hi I am @ethanholbrook

I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University working on under the advisement of Alejandro Strachan on solving computational materials engineering problems. 

Work interests: crystallography, LAMMPS, MLIAPs, automatic research, surfaces/interfaces, FAIR data (findable, accesible, interoperable, reusable)

In addition to my academic and research pursuits, I'm passionate about the great outdoors and physical fitness. I enjoy nature, hiking, running, and climbing, finding these activities not only rejuvenating but also a source of inspiration for my work. I'm also keen on social coordination, valuing the importance of building strong, collaborative communities both in and out of the academic sphere.
